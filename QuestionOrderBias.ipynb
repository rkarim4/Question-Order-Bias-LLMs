As the population ages, the demand for healthcare services, including long-term care, will likely increase significantly, which could lead to higher costs and potentially limited access to care. Additionally, the aging population may face financial challenges, as many may have limited retirement savings or face reduced income. This could make it difficult for them to afford the necessary healthcare and cost of living expenses. Another challenge could be the need for more age-friendly infrastructure and support services to enable the elderly to live independently for as long as possible.\",\n",
